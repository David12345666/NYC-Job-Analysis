## Project Description
This project will analyze both the NYC occupations and NYC government job offerings to find the relative statistics such as job categories, number of positions offered and salary information. Moreover, by analyzing and comparing the two datasets, we can get some insights of the trends and patterns of the New York job market in recent years and how people should be prepared for entering the job market.
